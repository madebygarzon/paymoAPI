Reports in Paymo are of several types:

* _static_ - This is the most common type. It represents data as it was at the moment of report creation.
* _live_ - Reports of this type are regenerated every time you view them. These are useful when you have to make periodic reports with the same parameters.
* _temp_ - Temporary reports are not stored, so you cannot see them inside the Paymo application. Use them when you only need the data from the report, without the report persisting in Paymo.

## Getting reports

You can list reports by making a GET request to:

* `/api/reports` for a list of all the reports
* `/api/reports?where=type=static` for a list of static reports
* `/api/reports?where=type=live` for a list of live reports
* `/api/reports?where=user_id=[USER_ID]` for a list of reports created by a user

   "type": "static",
   "date_interval": "this_month",
   "projects": "all_active",
   "users": [
      23130
   ],
   "clients": "all",
   "include": {
      "projects": true,

### Report format

A report will contain an `info` property that will represent real values for `start_date`, `end_date`, `clients`, `projects`, `users` parameters.

For example: 

If `date_interval` = `this_month` was sent as parameter for the report, `info` will contain `start_date` and `end_date` as real dates that represent this month.
If `projects` = `all_active`, the `info.projects` will contain a list of all active projects that were used to create the report.

All report content is contained in the `content` property.
