Paymo users are assigned to a company. The types of users are:
  
  * _Admins_, have rights to everything in a company.
  * _Employees_, have rights only to the projects they are assigned to.
  * _Project Managers_, same as _Employees_ users, but with manager roles for some projects.
  * _Guests_, limited access users for specific projects, usually represents a client.
   
To access Paymo, a user must be activated. The opposite of being activated is being retired (or archived) from Paymo.
Retired users cannot log into Paymo. 
   
The maximal number of active users in a company is set up in the Paymo subscription. Guest users do not count towards subscription user limit.

## Getting users

You can list users by making a GET request to:

* `/api/users` for a list of all users in the company.
* `/api/users?where=active=true` for a list of active users only.
* `/api/users?where=active=false` for a list of retired users.
* `/api/users?where=type=Admin` for a list of admin users.
* `/api/users?where=type=Employee` for a list of employees.

Example response for listing requests:

      {
         "id": 1,

```

<a name="create"></a>
## Creating a user

To create a user, make a POST request to:

* `/api/users`

with the request body containing the new user info, as in the example below:

```json
{
    "email": "kelly@dundermifflin.com",
    "type": "Employee",
    "assigned_projects": [28917],
    "password": "secret"
}
```

If successful, the response will return `201 Created`. The response body will contain the new user info as in the **Getting a user** section.

If your company does not have a paid Paymo subscription or you have reached the active users limit set up by the subscription, you will get a `403 Error: Could not add user. Maximum number of users reached.`

If the `password` attribute is sent, the user will have the desired password. If not, the user will not have a password set. 
If the user is added from the Paymo application, a Welcome to Paymo email will be sent which contains a link that will take the user through the setup process, where a name and a password will be set.

### Required fields 

When creating a user: `email`.

<a name="update"></a>
## Updating a user

To update an existing user, make a POST or PUT request to:

* `/api/users/[USER_ID]`

with the request body containing the updated info. You can send only the changed fields.

Example of request body if you want to change the list of assigned projects of a user:

```json
{
    "assigned_projects": [28917, 28918]
}
```

<a name="change-password"></a>
## Changing user password

To change a user's password, make an update request with new password, as in:

```json
{
    "password": "new password"
}
```

<a name="archive"></a>
## Archiving (retiring) or activating a user

To archive a user, make an update request with the following request body:

```json
{
    "active": false
}
```

To activate, send a `true` value.

<a name="add-image"></a>
## Adding a profile photo 

To add a user profile photo, make a POST request to:

* `/api/users/[USER_ID]`

The request content-type should be `multipart-form-data` and the file field name equal to `image`. Here's an example using `curl` command line:

```shell
curl -u email:password
  -H 'Accept: application/json'
  -F "image=@file.jpg"
  https://app.paymoapp.com/api/users/12345
```

Accepted image file formats are: JPEG, PNG, GIF.

The profile image of an user can be added when creating the user. In that case, all the user fields should be send in `multipart-form-data` format together with the file.

<a name="delete"></a>
## Deleting a user

To delete a user, make a DELETE request to:

* `/api/users/[USER_ID]`

### Warning

**Deleting a user will also delete all time logged by that user!**
